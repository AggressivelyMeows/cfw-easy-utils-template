# ðŸ¦„ Cloudflare Workers: Easy utils quick start
*"The best way to start using Cloudflare Workers" ~ Totally not Ceru*  

A Wangler template to get started using `cfw-easy-utils`. Write cleaner, easier-to-read code without breaking a sweat.

## How to edit
The worker's code is found in `index.js`.

## How to use
`wrangler generate projectname https://github.com/aggressivelymeows/cfw-easy-utils-template`  

*Its as simple as that depending on if you have Wrangler installed already. Follow [these guides](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler/install-update) for how to do that.*

Theres not really that much to it. I would recommend reading the docs for easy utils but its pretty self explanatory.
